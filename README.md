# Malicious-Files-and-URL-detection-app 🤖
Analysing Files and URL to detect whether malicious or not and classifying URLs into different categories.

# Templates/index.html file: 🤖


The index.html in the Templates folder contains HTML in Jinja 2 template , CSS code for design and JavaScript code for Logic.


# The main.py file: 🤖


This file contains the main backend code.Used Flask framework. Incorporated Google Gemini 1.5 flash Generative AI model to detect the scam files and the malicious URLs by putting prompts  and

# Accuracy: 🎯

The app predicts the malicious files and URLs with more than 85% of accuracy.🚀


# Lessons learnt During making this project: 🚧


Learnt to use Generative AI model in a project🤖

Learnt some good coding habits. For Eg: Not to use an API key directly on the main code. But make a .env file and then use it in a project 💡
